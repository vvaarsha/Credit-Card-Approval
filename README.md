# Credit-Card-Approval
this project is to create a machine learningâ€”based system that can predict credit card approval decisions

Credit Card Approval Prediction
This project is a Machine Learning-based solution to predict credit card approval status based on applicant details like income, employment status, credit history, and more. It was developed during my internship at Cybernaut Edu Tech.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw data for training.

Model Implementation: Built and compared models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.

Class Imbalance Handling: Used SMOTE to address data imbalance issues.

Model Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy with Logistic Regression as the best-performing model.

Technologies Used

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Seaborn, Matplotlib

How It Works:
User inputs features like income, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, etc.
The model predicts whether the credit card application will be approved or rejected.

Results
Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy (100%) in the dataset used for this project.
